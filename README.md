# Timeline

This is an attempt to visualize some parts of the world's history - namely, what happend at around the same time in different fields. What was music like while Goethe was alive? When exactly did Goya live?

## Accuracy
Obviously, we don't have accurate data. Since the visualization needs an exact date, I always used the next best thing, for example the birthing date. If only a year was available, it's always mapped to the first of January. If there's not even a single year, I used one in the middle. I took all data from Wikipedia.
If you have better dates (with sources), open a PR!

## Selection
I chose the selected people more or less arbitrarily. As the whole project is done to satisfy my curiosity, I feel this okay ðŸ˜‰.
If you have other suggestion, open a PR!

## Features
There's a lot of things I'd like to try and itegrate. Some will maybe work, some not. We'll see. If you have any ideas, tell me or open a PR!
